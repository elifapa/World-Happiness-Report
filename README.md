# World-Happiness-Report
## Project Goal:  
Goal is to see how happiness scores in 2015-2019 vary across the world. Also to have a better understanding about the features associated with low happiness scores. Also to answer the question of where is the world's least happiest place to live.
## Data Source:
This dataset can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). It is uploaded by Sustainable Development Solutions Network. You can also find the metadata there, also how Happiness Score is calculated is explained there.  
## Data Description:  
This dataset consists of 5 csv files for each year. Average datapoint in each file is around 156.
## Conclusion:  

In the first plot, you can see the mean happiness scores for 2015-2019 data for each region. This data is specifically important because one may observe how scores of countries vary within the region. Australia and New Zealand, as well as North America varies the least, since this dataset did not break down the data to countries or states for these regions. Data varies significantly in Middle East region as one may see from the whiskers.
In the second plot, one may observe how these scores change over the course of 5 years for each region. Middle East stands on somewhat middle position among the other regions, it is neither the most or the least happiest place to live.
In the third plot, Middle East region is being broken down to countries in the form of barplot. I also added the confidence intervals for the bars, however i excluded 2018-2019 data for the sake of readibility and also unfortunately, CI data was not available for these years. One may see the least happiest place to live is **Syria** regardless of the year.
